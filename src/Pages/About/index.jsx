        desc: 'Working in this field of study has taught me that it is just as important to collaborate and share ideas with my peers as it is to put my own foot forward and lead everyone myself. I could think my project through a hundred times and still miss the one piece that someone else could easily spot. Likewise, I could be sharing ideas with someone and help them figure out what else they could be working on. Collaborating with my peers means listening, finding common ground, and working on things that I might not be used to, just so that our shared project can get up off the ground. However, collaboration isn’t always a smooth and easy road to take, it’s not always as easy and straightforward as it should be. Collaboration and sharing leadership roles also means sharing the weight of responsibility through the rough patches as well. In some ways, this can bring a group closer as a shared learning experience. It can create an opportunity to learn how to communicate better, learn which group members are better at which roles, and it can provide a lesson on how to better think critically about these projects and situations. Two projects that I have worked on that are good examples of these lessons are when I remade the IMD homepage on the UWB website and had to create an elevator pitch for a currently relevant debate topic. My team and I were tasked with redesigning the IMD homepage for multiple reasons. There was too much text that made a design major page look chunky, it wasn’t updated regularly, it wasn’t interesting to read or look at, and it didn’t provide enough useful information. The first steps to redesigning it were figuring out what information we wanted to convey on the site. My group had to decide together how we wanted to split up the project and communicated what we were doing so that we were all on the same page. We had to make this new IMD homepage more cohesive than it was before - otherwise there would be no point in fixing it. We had to decide what was important information, as well as come up with a more interesting way to present information, and we wanted to make sure it was simple to navigate. In order to work quickly, the workload had to be shared; but we couldn’t just go our separate ways. We tried playing to our strengths - I really enjoy doing research and taking notes on it, one of my other groupmates preferred the writing process, and so on. However, I quickly learned that communication was going to be very important in order to create something that we could all be proud of, although overall the project was disappointing as by the end of it, we learned that higher-ups didn’t want to go through the complicated process to actually revamp the UW employee-made page. The second project was a research paper and elevator pitch proposal and was a good learning experience overall. My partners had trouble with communication which led to problems from the beginning. We had to spend time finding research papers, but because of the difficulty communicating we ended up finding some of the same papers, or other group members found irrelevant articles. There was also confusion about who was supposed to be working on what part of the project, when it had to be finished by, and a team member being sick for the whole research phase. This was a good learning experience for me in a few different ways. It helped me realize that I need to be open about my expectations and ideas instead of just doing all the work, and I learned that I should play to each person’s strengths instead of passing random roles to others, and I discovered how important it is to manage a group effectively..'

        desc: 'The use of critical thinking is incredibly important in any aspect of life, but especially when creating something that will be put out into the world. The ability to think critically can be difficult yet helpful in order to assess situations and decisions that may or may not be controversial, impractical or otherwise negative for a project in the long run. This type of thinking can be used to understand how something works by proposing the right kinds of questions and following through with a project until a satisfying conclusion is made. Creative thinking entails looking at the more subjective aspects of a project, such as aesthetics or purpose, and can help provide a look at all sides of the project being worked on that may be otherwise looked over. These two thinking styles go hand in hand when trying to create the perfect project. When working on sound design for a short game, I had to use my critical thinking skills. I had to sort out what sounds were important and how I could make them with the limited resources I had. I planned out what sounds would be easy, which would be more difficult, and what sounds I could do at the same time in order to use what little time I had wisely. This included thinking about what sounds I could record during the day when it was more busy and I was likely to get outside sounds, and what I should record at night when there wouldn’t be as many other sounds. For example, I needed to get a good sound clip of footsteps in grass, and while I tried to use resources I had inside, having carpet floor and linoleum floor as my only options, I wasn’t able to create something that sounded right to me. I also needed the sound of something burning to replicate a bonfire, but living in an apartment with no fireplace, I was obviously limited. I took a cardboard box I had out to an empty parking lot at 3am and used oil to light it on fire, and used my studio mic to record the sound of burning and I was so impressed with how it turned out afterwards, it sounded completely natural next to a bonfire in-game. On the same video game project, I also got to work on the music. I had to figure out a title screen song and an overworld theme song. I had to think creatively when trying to write these songs. I had to think about what tone they would convey, if they would grab attention, and if they would be pleasant to listen to while playing or waiting for the game to start. I have a background in music, so it was easy for me to get into the mindset of creating it, even if I didn’t have that much time to write and record. I had a few song ideas to play around with, but I needed to see how well they would fit into the theme of the game before I could definitively say they would work for what my team and I were working for. By asking the right questions and analyzing the game’s aesthetic, I was able to come up with two songs that I really enjoyed, a mellow but progressive menu theme and a lively orchestral overworld theme that switched to a more calm and composed version of the same song at night.'

        desc: 'Diversity and equity are important within any workplace. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to get ahead in life without any unnecessary obstacles getting in their way. Diversity adds so much experience, not just with how long someone might have been working for, but also in stories. There is a unique story that resides in every person, and with it, a unique perspective. This perspective can grant new angles for ideas that might not have been considered previously. Equity would grant each person an opportunity to tell those stories. I was able to create a diverse set of projects with the help of those I worked with, and with the help of those who set up the project goal in the first place. In one project of mine, I had to create a digital iOS sticker for a campaign that I care about. I chose the campaign Team Trees, which is a large organization whose goal is to plant one tree for every dollar donated. This organization has planted over 23 million trees so far, creating an expansive and diverse array of trees across the U.S. I created this sticker in a 2D format, as opposed to my usual 3D preference. Doing this helped me to diversify my knowledge more and allow me to try something I am less familiar with. The more that I can try new things and expand my knowledge, the more I will be able to express myself and relate to others. Being in IAS at UWB was a very culturally rich experience for me, with most of my groupmates across all of my projects being underrepresented minorities. Being able to gain new experiences and work with more diverse people and projects will help me to understand how to correctly create a workplace of equity, which is something I was never really taught to even consider in K-12. I will learn how to relate to each person and listen to their different perspectives on life. It is important to let everyone feel listened to, especially when working together. The other project I worked on began as something I didn’t know how to start, but ended up becoming a show of equity for myself. I had to create a video, at least a minute long, of something that I have to deal with every single day. Everything that first came to mind seemed overdone and maybe even too boring. So I decided to make this video as a way to describe how I have medical conditions that I have to live with that make working much more difficult. I was diagnosed with a few sleeping disorders that prevent me from sleeping the same way that everyone else does. Sometimes I cannot fall asleep no matter how hard I try, and sometimes I can sleep all day long and I have no control over it. I showed my struggle by displaying how difficult it is for me to fall asleep, and how even after I work hard to tire myself out, my body will not cooperate. The end of the video shows how I struggle to fall asleep at night when I want to, but have no problem sleeping through my many alarms once daylight starts showing. This video I made shows how I don’t have the equity that many others do when it comes to daily routine. I get behind in my work, I don’t get to socialize as much as I would like to, and I’m unable to force myself awake to stay on task. My use of editing to speed up footage of tossing and turning in bed at night mixed with hard cuts to later times at night (shown by a screenshot of my phone and the time as I checked it) as well as sleeping through blaring alarms in the morning showcased a sense of storytelling of my struggles through an accurate perspective.'

        desc: 'Research is an important aspect of any new project. It must be determined if a similar project has been done before, if the idea is relevant, and there needs to be a thorough investigation into the topic. There should be questions that span across any perspective that others might have in order to create a confident project that can answer and quell any doubts that may be had by the audience. This area of the project can take the most time because it’s important to be thorough when doing research. If too hasty, then too much could be missed, such as a good reason to not carry on with the project. Or the research may turn out to provide evidence of the opposite of any previous hypotheses, leaving the project to be counterintuitive. Recently I had to research a currently relevant debate topic and present it. My group and I chose to research the topic of whether or not video games are truly “addictive” to the extent that tangible things like substances are. As someone who enjoys video games, I went into this topic with the least amount of bias possible. I read through articles that claimed they weren’t addictive, which was my initial inclination, as well as those that were set to prove they are, as there’s always been a negative stigma about video games, especially in the older generations. It was a pretty gray area, as you’d have to determine things like what you define as “addictive”, as well as many other variables. Researching across different points of knowledge and reading through other perspectives allowed me to ask more questions and open my mind to other perspectives, and had my initial opinion flipped the more I worked on the project. In the end, I was able to write a research paper and present to my audience in a clear way that achieved the goal. In the other project I worked on, I had to create a mobile game. This was something I had never done before, and the instructions we were given were pretty confusing and unclear, so I needed to research a lot to make up for information I was missing. My project was a simple word-guessing game where the player had to guess the correct word without losing all of the apples on the tree, similar in concept to hangman. Not only did I have to research the appropriate steps to take to clear up contradictions from the given instructions, but I had to study other word-guessing games in order to find what makes them fun and what makes them flop. I had to ask questions about what people wanted to be entertained by, what was popular at the time, and how many chances each person should get before losing. Too many chances and the game would be easy, but too littles chances and the game would be near impossible, and it would also depend on the word (even with the same amount of letters different words would have different difficulty, etc), so it was hard to fine tune what would work. I was able to present a good mobile game in the end by researching across many online platforms of games, troubleshooting, even contacting support for software, and overall analyzing my options and researching appropriately.'

        desc: 'Being able to connect with an audience is an important part of creation. It will help to form a bond with those who can find motivation or purpose within a project. This is seen in the style of video games, books, movies, and music. Writing is a great way to communicate the purpose of a project, and there are two popular ways to do so. One way to communicate with the audience is to lead them directly where they’re supposed to go; this is done by spelling out the story, being direct in the words being said, and having the ending be very clear cut. The other way to communicate is by doing the opposite; this allows the audience to make up their own ending and feel empowered by choice. I prefer to send a clear message so there is no confusion for my audience. For my first project, my group and I had to come up with a short advertisement for a fake app that we would create. All of us in our group were musicians, and we were bonding over our frustration of difficulty finding local musicians with similar tastes to play with or create a band with. As such, we decided to make a “Tinder but for musicians” type of app with similar UI and functionality, where you create a profile, list your interests in genres, favorite bands, what instruments you play, and otherwise. For our video ad, we had to write a script that would convey what kind of app that our “company” would create. We had to make it interesting to the viewer, as well as provide enough context so that any audience member could understand and enjoy our advertisement in the limited amount of time we had to film. I got to handle the editing process for this project, which is an extension of the writing we worked on. Editing this video lets me express other moods that might not come across well in just the writing portion. Putting in music, cutting to certain people, and adding additional B roll of my choosing all helps to tell the story that I want the audience to know. Another project that shows how I communicate my purpose to the audience is one that I made by myself. It shows me detailing how my sleep disorders affect my daily life, and how much of a struggle it can be to work because of it. I wanted to get this message across without talking, so it would capture more attention. The video showed me trying and failing to fall asleep, trying to tire myself out, failing to sleep from it, and then finally falling asleep when the early morning light was already coming through the window. I believe my work clearly indicated my point, and I was able to communicate a specific and clear story with my audience.'

                <p> My time at the University of Washington over the last four years has been a huge mixed bag filled with a lot of ups, downs, and personal growth stemming from obstacles and hardships thrown my way. Upon being admitted to UW Seattle, I was soon notified that my intended major was being canceled. Scrambling to find an option and opportunity to stay within the greater UW family, I was put in touch with the right people at UW Bothell to apply for the IMD program - which I then left for various reasons to transfer into IAS. Taking brand new/different prerequisites, moving twice, changing jobs multiple times, and overall completely upending my life all in the pursuit of my degree has been a very challenging and life changing experience that has really shaped who I’ve become today.
One major intended goal and takeaway from the IAS program is the aspect of “collaboration and shared leadership”, the general concept of working together in group projects to make a final product evoke the notion of “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. From a research project followed by mock elevator pitch to fund said project, to creating a brand new product and creating an advertisement for it, IAS has really pushed group work to prepare me for the outside world and what working in a team at a job in my field would look like. For example, just before Covid started, I went on a school field trip to a design firm which introduced us to their team members and departments, how their business operates, and other inner workings of the company. A large portion of their employees would be grouped into teams and given a project for an external company to work on, for example, the external company would have a problem they’re not sure how to solve, so they’d approach the design firm for solutions and see what they come up with price quotes on the lower and higher end to give their client options, and so on. On the project in my portfolio where we gave an elevator pitch for a fake company to fund us, this is exactly what we did - we were given a problem, tasked with finding a solution to the problem, designing a solution and taking real-world variables such as budget into account, then scripting and pitching that idea to the “company interested in investing”. This process definitely felt like I learned a lot to prepare for what the workforce has in store for me and feel like it directly applies to my future professional prospects that my educational experience in IAS has set me up for, and it’s just one example of extensive group work I’ve done across the program.
I think more so than anything, IAS (and IMD) gave me the opportunities to substantially expand my knowledge and skills outside of what I was used to doing, which has given me the room to grow into a very multifaceted artist. I had initially committed to UW originally wanting to hyperfocus on 3D animation and modeling, which wasn’t much of an option at UW, especially with my initial major being canceled. Through IAS, I was exposed to and took part in all kinds of different art forms and software, from UI/UX design in mobile apps and websites, to 2D art via Photoshop and Illustrator, to making music and SFX for a larger video game creation project.
Making music and SFX for a video game was one of the coolest things I had the opportunity to do during my time in IAS, and definitely not something I would have expected to do. Video games are definitely a passion of mine and one of the main reasons I became interested and involved with animation and modeling in the first place, whilst writing and playing music has been a large part of my life since I was a young child. While it wasn’t quite the animation experience I was looking for, being able to blend two of my larger passions and inspirations as a creator within my major was a time I really felt the ability to express myself and show off my various abilities as an artist. Creating music was something I had already been familiar with prior to this project, but being in charge of all aspects of sound design throughout the game project, this also entailed SFX, which I was entirely unfamiliar with creating in the past. Creating bonfire, water, foliage, and many other sound effects that were able to blend naturally into the digital environment we’d created made me really appreciate the work that goes into creating audio for a game. I never thought I would see myself spending over an hour getting the “perfect footstep” sound that I would expect to hear while playing a game myself, and editing all of the audio I recorded in post to loop seamlessly and mix well with the other environmental SFX and game music took even longer. I hope that in whatever job I land in the future, whether it’s animation or otherwise, I’m able to put my various different skills to use, or at least that my employer sees the opportunity to use my talents to fill some “jack of all trades” role.
IAS firmly believes that self identification and understanding are important roles that shape who we are as artists and individuals, and challenging me to think about that actively and intertwining it with the work I was making was a very unique experience and an important part of my education in the major. One glaring example of this was a performance art video I made about a series of disabilities that constantly affects my life. Not only is physical performance art on the polar opposite end of the spectrum from what I was intending to do as a career, but the assignment prompted me to relate it to myself in a way that exposes and utilizes my own state of vulnerability. I really had to think outside of the box and truly think critically - another important core learning objective of IAS - as to how I could create a work like this, as my brain generally tends to be very geared towards the “left-brain” way of thinking, which is to say that creative thinking is something that doesn’t come to me very naturally. Creating a 90-second performance video about my sleep disorders and how that affects me and my day/night was not only challenging from a scripting and filming perspective, but being able to capture the difficulty with sleep, something that takes place over eight plus hours, in just 90 seconds was a task in itself. Working through this process definitely taught me more about myself, my own problem solving skills and really broke down my processes (from conceptualization, to writing, to performing, to editing and more) from start to finish in a way that I wasn’t inherently consciously aware of before, and I think those skills really propelled me forward in that I have a better understanding of my workflow, flaws, execution, and that it applies to much more than this hyper-specific assignment.
The IAS program and especially UW as a whole was a very different and unique experience, especially from my perspective given all of the difficulties and educational stumbles along the way. I think I’ve definitely gained a lot of skills and capabilities that apply to so much more than creating art during my educational journey. I was prepared for the workforce with group projects, meetings and pitches, making music and sound effects for a video game, scripting and performing a performance art piece, and so much more. This was all from a background in animation and in pursuit of a digital art degree, and with the work I’ve done, I think I’ve become a much more multifaceted and extensive artist. Please feel free to look into my portfolio for a catalogue of my proudest works I’ve done at UWB over the years, and will only continue to expand as I move forward into the workforce and with my hobbies.
